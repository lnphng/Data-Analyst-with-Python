- Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, I excercise:
   - how to read `gz` file, 
   - clean up data with problems involving `timestamp` and 
   - visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. 
- Data set are incluced with almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors, I did some little data cleaning and wrangling. 
- After that I gained insights about the development activities over the last 13 years and visualized it.

#### For this Project, I reviewed knowledge of: 
- Importing data with pandas
- Data Manipulation with pandas
- Manipulating Time Series Data in Python
